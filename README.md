# VRPTW Solver

## Overview

This project provides a solution framework for the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW) by Heuristic-based route construction and Metaheuristics refinement.

---

## Features
- **Insertion Heuristic**: A flexible and efficient strategy for route optimization, considering distance and time constraints.
- **Solver Factory**: Facilitates easy switching between different solving strategies, including the newly added Insertion Heuristic.
- **Enhanced Route Management**: The `Route` model supports dynamic customer insertion, automatically recalculating total demand and distance.

## Solver Factory

The `SolverFactory` in `src/solvers/__init__.py` allows for easy selection among different solver strategies based on their names. Supported solvers are "greedy", "insertion", and "random". This flexibility enables quick comparisons and benchmarking across various algorithms.

## Extending the Solver

To add new solver algorithms, implement the solver class in `src/solvers/`, ensuring it inherits from `BaseSolver` and implements the required methods. Register the new solver in the `SolverFactory` for seamless integration.

---

## Setup

1. Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed on your system.
2. Install required Python packages:

```bash
pip install numpy plotly
```

3. Place your problem instance JSON files in the `data/` directory.

## Usage

You can specify the solver type dynamically via the `SolverFactory` interface.
To run the solver with a problem instance, execute the `main.py` script:

```bash
python main.py
```

This script will load the problem instance, calculate the distance matrix, run the solver, and plot the resulting routes.

## Visualization

The visualization module uses `plotly` to plot the routes generated by the solver. Each route is displayed with different markers and lines for easy differentiation.
