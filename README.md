# VRPTW Solver

## Overview

This project provides a solution framework for the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW). It includes an implementation of Insertion Heuristics for generating initial routes and a visualization module for plotting those routes.

```

## Setup

1. Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed on your system.
2. Install required Python packages:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

3. Place your problem instance JSON files in the `data/` directory.

## Usage

To run the solver with a problem instance, execute the `main.py` script:

```bash
python main.py
```

This script will load the problem instance, calculate the distance matrix, run the solver, and plot the resulting routes.

## Visualization

The visualization module uses `matplotlib` to plot the routes generated by the solver. Each route is displayed with different markers and lines for easy differentiation.
